A collection of useful Emacs Lisp code that isn't substantial enough to be packaged.  This code will be maintained here so that it can be updated and improved over time.

This can be viewed directly on the [[http://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el][repository]] or as [[http://alphapapa.github.io/unpackaged.el][HTML]].

Contributions welcome!

Functions in this file generally use these helper packages:

+  [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]] (including ~dash-functional~)
+  [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]]
+  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]

* Usage

There are two ways to use the code in this "unpackage":

+  Buffet :: Choose the the parts you want and copy them into your init files.
+  Whole-hog :: Load the file =unpackaged.el=, which is tangled from this Org file, e.g. ~(require 'unpackaged)~.

In general, your editor will attempt to avoid code that modifies Emacs state by simply loading the tangled "unpackage," but this is not strictly guaranteed.  Please report any problems.

An easy way to "whole-hog it" is to use [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]] like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (use-package unpackaged
    :quelpa (unpackaged :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/unpackaged.el"))
#+END_SRC

*Note:* I can't seem to find a way to hide these elisp header sections from the GitHub Org renderer without also preventing them from being tangled.  The =COMMENT= to-do keyword causes Org to not tangle them.  Help would be appreciated!

** Ensure blank lines between headings and before contents

Ensure that blank lines exist between headings and between headings and their contents.  With prefix, operate on whole buffer.  Ensures that blank lines exist after each headings's drawers.

** Refile to datetree file using earliest/latest timestamp in entry

Refile current entry to datetree using timestamp found in entry.  ~WHICH~ should be ~earliest~ or ~latest~. If ~SUBTREE~-P is non-nil, search whole subtree.

This is sort of like archiving to a datetree, but it uses either the earliest or latest timestamp found in the entry or subtree rather than the current date.  It's helpful if you have an entry with lots of timestamps or log entries, and you're done with it, and you want to file it in a datetree in a leaf matching either when you started working on the entry or when you finished, using the first or last timestamp found anywhere in the entry.

/Note:/ If you can think of a more concise name for this command, please send it in!

** Read-only trees

This code applies the =read-only= text-property to trees tagged =read_only=, preventing them from being modified accidentally.  (Note: If read-only headings appear in an Agenda buffer, it can cause slightly unusual behavior.  Usually this is not an issue.)  This was originally inspired by John Kitchin's [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/09/13/Make-some-org-sections-read-only/][blog article]] and later [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/92k7n1/guide_to_profiling_and_optimizing_an_orgrelated/][rewritten]] in a faster version.

To use, load these functions, and then add to this hook to automatically mark read-only sections when an Org file is loaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'unpackaged/org-mark-read-only)
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade a ~quelpa-use-package~ form's package

Eval the current ~use-package~ form with ~quelpa-upgrade-p~ true.  Deletes old versions of the package first to remove obsolete versions.

This makes it easy to upgrade a package you install with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]] without having to add ~:upgrade t~ to the form, which would cause Quelpa to /always/ upgrade the package every time Emacs loads.

e.g. it should allow selecting directories, and then presenting the images in them.  Maybe filenames should also be displayed next to each image.  So maybe it should somehow be a wrapper or advice to ~helm-find-files~ or ~helm-comp-read~ that simply adds images to the filename strings.
